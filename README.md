# Project 0 - Portfolio v1.0

ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

For this project, I put togther a brief portfolio website, giving background on myself,
some of my course work, and other interesting things.

In total there are 4 .html pages:
	- index.hmtl contains the home page for the site with a summary of what to expect
	- page1.html contains some information about me and my hobbies
	- page2.html contains current coursework and will updated to showcase some of my projects
	- page3.html is a blog space where I intend to post interesting topics/articles

The sass folder contains a .scss file for webpage styling. 
The .scss file is converted to a .css file using Scout-App, provided on the Sass website.

The Images folder contains .png or .jpg pictures used on the website.
